This was an assignment for my very first college programming class. I completed the assignment in about 15 minutes and decided to keep working on it.
Over the course of a few hours, a basic assignment turned into an almost complete game. I am very proud of this project and plan to come back to it
to finish it and maybe put it up for download!
